        <h2>Black Ops 6</h2>

        <p>
          I usally dont get too excited for new cod releases, but treyarch is my
          favourite studio and with the announcment of a return to normal round
          based zombies i am pretty excited for this game but i never get my
          hopes up to high for cod titles.

        <h2>Gta 6</h2>
        <p>
          I still play gta 5 to this day, i think its one of the greatest games
          of all time, and GTA 6 has had far more development time and has been
          revealed to have a much larger map, so i am excited for all the new
          things that will be available.

        <h2>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>

        <p>
          This game is a revival of my favourite dragon ball series, the
          tenkaichi series. i used to play those games all day on the ps2 and
          for some reason they never remastered or re released those games so i
          wasnt able to play them anymore, having the series reboot is a dream
          come true for me.
