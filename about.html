        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
          This is a website I have created for
          <strong>Assignment #1 of CPAN 134</strong>, where I will be discussing
          one of my favourite hobbies, which is gaming.

        <h3>How I Started</h3>
        <p>
          My gaming journey began when I was 5 years old playing various story
          mode games on my PS2. I played <i>Ratchet and Clank</i>,
          <i>Sly Cooper</i>, and <i>Jak and Daxter</i>. Those were my favourite
          games. A few years later, when I turned 7, my brother bought us a PS3,
          and from there I started playing his copy of COD 4 Modern Warfare,
          which is what got me into first-person shooter franchises. From there,
          I played every single Call of Duty up until WWII. After which, I took
          a 2-3 year break from gaming. About 3-4 months ago, I picked up an
          Xbox and started playing the older Call of Dutys again because
          Activision was acquired by Microsoft, and they revived the servers.
          That revived my old love for gaming, and I’ve been playing more
          consistently these days on my PS5. I just recently built a new gaming
          PC that I will be using as well.

        <h3>Why I Enjoy Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          The main reason I enjoy gaming is mostly the competitive fun that
          comes with it. After a long day, I like to hop on with my friends and
          play some sort of objective multiplayer game, usually either Black Ops
          Zombies or Fortnite, and sometimes GTA 5. I feel like after a long
          day, it’s a nice escape and destressor. However, I only really have
          about 1 hour a day available to even play, but when I was a kid, I
          played for hours a day. It’s kind of hard to describe why exactly I
          enjoy it so much, but it’s just a fun experience.
