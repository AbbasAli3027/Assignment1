#Introduction
This report covers the development of my gaming hobby website for the CPAN 134 Assignment 1. The site shows off my love for gaming and includes sections that highlight different aspects of my hobby. I'll go over why I made certain design choices, talk about how I built the site, and explain how I used GitHub to manage the project.

#Design Choices
HTML Structure
For the HTML structure, I used HTML5 elements to keep things semantic and accessible. The site has a header, footer, and navigation bar that appear on all pages. The main content is split into clear sections to help with readability and structure.

#Content and Styling
Content is organized with headings, paragraphs, and lists to make it easy to read. I used bold and italic text for emphasis. On the "About" page, I added a table with info about my favorite games, their release dates, and platforms.

The CSS is external to keep things consistent. The color scheme sticks to shades of blue and white, with a tomato color for links. This keeps the design cohesive and visually appealing. CSS also helps with backgrounds and basic layout to keep the site looking neat.

#Forms and Inputs
On the "Contact" page, there's a form where users can enter their name, email, and a message. There's a submit button, and while it doesn't actually send data to a server, it shows a "Submission received" message and clears the fields when you hit submit.

#Multimedia Elements
I included a bunch of images and videos to make the site more engaging. There's a carousel on the homepage with images of my top three games. On the "Upcoming Games" page, I embedded YouTube trailers for games I'm excited about, which adds some interactivity.

#CSS Styling
I aimed for a visually appealing and consistent design with a limited color palette. I used flexbox for the carousel and made sure the videos were responsive. Proper class names were used throughout to keep the CSS organized and easy to maintain.

#Theme and Creativity
The whole site sticks to the gaming theme. The design is unique and reflects my personal interests in gaming. There are multiple pages, all linked properly, so navigation is smooth and everything feels connected.

#Implementation Process
I started by planning the site's structure and content. I sketched out some wireframes to get a sense of the layout. Then I built the basic structure with HTML and CSS.

To make the homepage interactive, I added JavaScript for a carousel that lets users browse through images of my favorite games. Event listeners handle the carousel's previous and next buttons.

I tested the site on different screen sizes to make sure it was responsive. Whenever I spotted an issue, I tweaked the CSS and HTML to fix it.

#GitHub Project Management
I set up a GitHub repository to host all the site's code. This includes HTML, CSS, and media files. I created tasks in GitHub projects to break down the work, which helped me stay on track and make sure I was hitting all the requirements.

The repository is private, and I've invited my instructor as a collaborator so they can access the code. The report is included in the repository and I've also submitted it on Blackboard, along with the GitHub link.

#Conclusion
Building my gaming hobby website was a fun and educational experience. I got to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while showcasing my passion for gaming.
